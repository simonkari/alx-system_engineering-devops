Issue Summary:

Duration of outage:
The outage occurred from 10:30 AM to 1:45 PM (UTC) on October 14, 2023.
Impact: The service affected was our e-commerce website, resulting in a slowdown and intermittent unavailability. Approximately 25% of users experienced slow page loading times, while 5% were unable to access the website during the peak of the incident.
Root Cause: The root cause was a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting our infrastructure.
Timeline:

Detection: 
The issue was detected at 10:30 AM through a spike in network traffic, triggering our DDoS detection system.
Actions Taken: Our incident response team immediately began investigating the source of the traffic surge. Initially, we assumed it might be a sudden increase in legitimate user traffic due to a marketing campaign. We also explored the possibility of a misconfigured CDN or server issue.
Misleading Paths: While investigating, we briefly considered a misconfiguration on our CDN, but further analysis ruled that out. We also initially suspected a sudden influx of legitimate traffic but realized the traffic patterns were indicative of a DDoS attack.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the Security Team and the Network Operations Center (NOC) to handle the DDoS mitigation efforts.
Resolution: We mitigated the DDoS attack by implementing rate limiting, traffic filtering, and blocking malicious IPs. The service returned to normal at 1:45 PM.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: 
The issue was caused by a DDoS attack that flooded our network with a high volume of malicious traffic, overwhelming our servers and network infrastructure.
Resolution: To address the issue, we implemented rate limiting and traffic filtering rules on our firewalls to block the malicious traffic. Additionally, we engaged with our DDoS protection service provider to further mitigate the attack and identify the attackers for potential legal action.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:
Enhance DDoS mitigation capabilities: We will review and improve our DDoS protection measures to proactively handle similar attacks in the future.
Real-time traffic monitoring: Implement real-time traffic monitoring to detect and respond to abnormal traffic patterns more effectively.
Incident response training: Conduct incident response training to ensure our teams can quickly and accurately identify and mitigate future incidents.

Tasks:
Review and update DDoS protection measures.
Implement real-time traffic monitoring and alerts.
Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for further improvement.
Enhance collaboration with the legal team for potential legal action against attackers.
Review and revise incident response procedures to incorporate lessons learned from this incident.
