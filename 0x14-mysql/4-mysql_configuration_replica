# This MySQL database server configuration file.

# You can copy this file to one of the following locations:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to configure global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to configure user-specific options.

# You can use all the long options supported by the program.
# To see the available options, run the program with "--help."
# Use "--print-defaults" to view the options the program would use.

# For detailed explanations, refer to the documentation:
