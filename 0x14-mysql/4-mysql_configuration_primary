# MySQL Configuration File

# You can utilize this file to configure various options for the MySQL server. 
# To apply these settings globally, duplicate this file to "/etc/mysql/my.cnf." 
# For user-specific options, create or edit "~/.my.cnf."

# The program supports all long options. Run the program with "--help" 
# to view a list of available options, and "--print-defaults" to see the settings it will use.

# For detailed explanations, please consult the documentation:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html

# The following settings will be applied to all MySQL clients. 
# It's advisable to enclose passwords with ticks/quotes, particularly if they include "#" characters. 
# Don't forget to update "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf" when altering the socket location.

# Below are specific entries tailored for certain scenarios, assuming your system has at least 32MB of RAM.

# Logging and Replication

# Uncomment these lines to enable it.

# InnoDB Configuration
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB data file in /var/lib/mysql/.
# For additional InnoDB options, refer to the manual.

# Security Features
# For security best practices, consult the manual.
# If you intend to create a chroot environment, uncomment this line.
